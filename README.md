# Lexis â€” an immersive language learning app

## Overview
### Description
Fetches articles / reading material on desired topics from various sources like the New York Times, Wikipedia, books, or poems, but translates random words into target learning language to allow language learning in context. Users can also study seen words through flashcards / writing quizzes or upload their own content. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** Allows language learning on the go, plus games and quizzes are very suited for mobile. It could also use the camera for uploading content. 
- **Story:** Users can simultaneously learn their target language and get more information / current news on topics that they're interested in. Games allow them to practice their vocabulary in a more "traditional" language learning context. 
- **Market:** Anybody who wants to practice their target language could potentially use this app. One challenge would be to ensure the difficulty is appropriate for the level of the learner (but this is probably beyond the scope of my FBU project).
- **Habit:** Could display stats + push notifications about their vocabulary learning to keep users coming back. The content being curated to the user's interests would also help them use the app more. 
- **Scope:** V1 would fetch content from an outside source and translate random words within it into the target language, plus show the translations + meaning of the words. V2 would incorporate a vocabulary view where users can see words that they've previously seen, and games / flashcards for additional practice. V3 would allow users to choose the type of content that they want to see. V4 would allow users to upload their own content.
